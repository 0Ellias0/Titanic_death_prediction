# Titanic Survival Predictions 

This repository contains code and documentation for the Titanic Survival Predictions competition on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this competition can be found on the Kaggle competition page: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## Models

In this project, we explore the performance of several machine learning models for predicting Titanic survival. We have tested the following models:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB)
3. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
4. Voting Classifier with Logistic Regression, BernoulliNB, and SVC
